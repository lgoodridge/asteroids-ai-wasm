# Asteroids AI WASM

A [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) implementation of Asteroids, and several Neural Network algorithms to play it.

This project is the spiritual successor to a previous, python-based [Asteroids AI](https://github.com/lgoodridge/Asteroids-AI) project.

It was also insipired by **gilhooleyd**'s Rust / WASM implementation of [Game of Life](https://github.com/gilhooleyd/wasm-game-of-life), and the [Rust and WebAssembly](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/introduction.html) web book.
